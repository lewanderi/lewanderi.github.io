				<h3>General info</h3>
				<p>Weligama is located on a picturesque bay. Bigger hotels, more bars, more action. Good place to meet other people.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>The surf</h3>
				<p>A bay with mellow waves. Different sections break at different heights. Left and rights available. Middle of the bay has the best waves, but the most crowds. Expect heavy traffic in the water during most of the day.
					The water isn't as clean and turqoise as in other places. If you want to spend time around other people and meet new friends, Weligama is for you.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Where to stay?</h3>
				<p>If you fancy having a stay close to the beach and meeting like-minded people, I recommend staying at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/lucky-39-s-surf-camp.html" target="_blank">Lucky's Surf Camp.</a>
					Hosted by Sri Lanka's #1 surfer, Lucky, it's worth checking out. You can also get lessons here.</p>
