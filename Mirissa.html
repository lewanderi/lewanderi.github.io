				<h3>General info</h3>
				<p>Mirissa is a lovely little town in the southern part of Sri Lanka, about 2,5 hour drive from the capital Colombo. It has a laid-back vibe and beautiful, clean beaches. You can access all the spots along the coastline super easily and affordably by local bus. Check out Google Maps for timetables.</p>

				<h3>The surf</h3>
				<p>Mirissa has two surf spots that you can choose from based on your skill level. The spot at the end of the beach next to the cliff is for more advanced surfers. 
					It's a fun but quite short right-hander. Hazards include sea urchins, shallow water and once you're on the wave, the beach closes in fast on you.</p>
				<p>The other spot is more open and suitable for intermediates. It's a fun, mellow left-hander that can break for quite a long in the right conditions. Requires a bit of a paddle.
					Don't go too far to the right, as the water gets real shallow real fast. You can rent boards next to the beach. Ask for some tips from the locals.</p>

				<h3>Where to stay?</h3>
				<p>If you get by with basic amenities, choose <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/sandu-guest.html" target="_blank">Sandu Guest</a>. It is hosted by a lovely local family and has two rooms. Super friendly vibes and good value for money!</p>
